## NFT Raffle app

Create a NFT raffle where the owner of the contract can select an NFT to put up for raffle. Users purchase raffle tickets and a random winner will be selected and transferred the NFT.

## Features
- Owner can start a raffle by providing the NFT contract and token ID of the NFT raffle prize (Checks to see if the NFt is owned by the owner)

- Owner can start and stop the raffle manually at any time
